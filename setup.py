The Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a library for composing asynchronous and
event-based programs using observable sequences and C# LINQ-style query operators.
Using Rx, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables,
query asynchronous data streams using LINQ operators,
and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers.
Simply put, Rx = Observables + LINQ + Schedulers.

Requires concurrent.futures backport (pip install futures)
